# shadcn/ui on Rails

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/shadcn-ui.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/shadcn-ui)

[Shadcn on Rails](https://shadcn.themesonrails.com) provides customizable components that you can
copy and paste into your apps. Free. Open Source. **Use this to build your own component library**.

**If you're using this, [please let me know](https://twitter.com/aviflombaum) so I keep developing
it.**

## About

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and
paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs.
The code is yours.

Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries.

## Installation

Refer to
[Installation](https://github.com/aviflombaum/shadcn-rails/blob/main/app/views/documentation/installation.html.md)
or the [Installation](https://shadcn.themesonrails.com/docs/installation) page on the demo site.

## [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)

These components are based on the components provided by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). Because
`shadcn-ui` is so heavily reliant on Radix and React, these components are most likely not going to
be 1:1 copies of the components provided by `shadcn-ui`. However, the goal is to provide the same
components with the same API and the same accessibility features. If you are looking for a React
component library, I highly recommend checking out [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).
